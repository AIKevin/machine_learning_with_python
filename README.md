Here is a Python version of my R machine learning courses I have been following in 2018. Feel free to go through it to get familiar with libraries such as Pandas, Numpy and Sci-Kit Learn.

The topics covered by these courses are:

  -Simple Linear Regression

  -Logistic Regression

  -Discriminant Analysis

  -Principal Component Analysis


Using Pandas, Numpy and Sci-Kit Learn.
